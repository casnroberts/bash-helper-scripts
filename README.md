# Bash helper scripts
These are a few helper functions written in Bash that I use to help with daily tasks that are repetitive and eat up time.

*Caveat: I am not a sysadmin so these scripts may be somewhat fragile.*  Hardening pull requests greatly appreciated!

If you find bugs or make updates to these scripts that would be beneficial to others, please contribute them back to the community.
